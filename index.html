    HTML was created by the original "web developer", computer scientist <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tim_Berners-Lee">Time Berners-Lee<a/>. It's not true that Sir Tim invented HTML in order to share pictures of his cat, but it would be cool if it were.

      Michael is the creator of the <a href="http://railstutorial.org/" target="_blank"> <em>Ruby on Rails Tutorial</em> </a> and principal author of the <a href="http://learnenough.com/">Learn Enough to Be Dangerous</a> introductory sequence. He is an advanced student of <a href="http://kravmaga.com/"><strong>Krav Maga</strong></a> and has a three-step plan for world domination. Rumors that he's secretly a supervillain are slightly exaggerated.

      Learn Enough to Be Dangerous was founded in 2015 by Michael Hartl, Lee Donahoe, and Nick Merwin. We believe that the kind of technical sophistication taught by the Learn Enough tutorials can benefit <strong>at least a billion people.</strong> and probably more.<br>

      William Shakespeare's <em>Sonnets</em> consists of 154 poems, each fourteen lines long (three <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quatrain">quatrains</a> followed by a rhyming <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Couplet">couplet</a>).
        <Strong>Sonnet 18</strong> is perhaps the most famous, and begins like this:
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        Shall I compare thee to a summer's day?<br>
        Thou are more lovely and more temperate.<br>
        Rough winds do shake the darling buds of May,<br>
        And summer's lease hath all too short a date.
      </p>
